# Windows Internal Training

## TL;DR
Quite frankly, this training is for anyone **but** those looking to skim material with a brief TL;DR section. Rather, it caters best to security professionals looking to roll up their sleeves and dive deep into the cogs and gears of the Windows operating system. If you fit this description, read on closely and carefully. 

## Credit Where Credit is Due
A thousand thanks to [Pavel Yosifovich](https://twitter.com/zodiacon) for authoring the content for this training and delivering it to myself and my fellow attendees during unsavory hours to accommodate our respective time zones.

## The Who
### Your Guide
Pavel Yosifovich literally rewrote and updated the book on Windows Internals (alongside [Alex Ionescu](https://twitter.com/aionescu), credit to original authors [Mark Russinovich](https://twitter.com/markrussinovich) and David A. Solomon as well) to cover material specific to the releases of Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10. You couldn't be in better hands but if you're still skeptical, check out his [blog](http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/pavely/) and [GitHub repos](https://github.com/zodiacon?tab=repositories).

### Who Should Take This Training?
Offensive and defensive information security professionals interested in Windows security will benefit greatly from this course. Crafting a detailed and in-depth understanding of both Microsoft's security model as well as the architectural designs and operations of the Windows operating system empower security folks with the ability effectively attack and defend Windows endpoints. If you're an offensive security researcher, red teamer, etc. and you have a particular interest in attacking Windows, do yourself a favor and put this training at the top of your list.

## The What
Pavel's [Windows Internals training](https://scorpiosoftware.net/2018/08/17/public-remote-windows-internals-training/)  traverses the content within the [Windows Internals Part 1 (7th edition) book](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189) in great detail across five days, covering the following eight topics:

1. System Architecture
2. Processes and Jobs
3. Threads
4. Kernel Mecanisms
5. Memory Management
6. Management Mecanisms
7. I/O System
8. Security

Pavel supplements and enforces a vast majority of this content with open-sourced Windows tooling, various coding projects, and sessions spent in the wonderful world of WinDbg (this is **not** sarcasm, WinDbg is powerful and awesome). This hands-on time gives trainees the experience needed to pursue efforts above and beyond the scope of the given training material, which is vital for both offensive security researchers looking to poke holes in the Windows OS and blue teamers validating and buffing their security controls.

## The Where
This particular instance of Pavel's training was delivered remotely, but keep track of his Twitter account and website for upcoming training locations.
