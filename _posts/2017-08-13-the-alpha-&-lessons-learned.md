As stated in my ["about me"](/about) page, there have been more than a few conversations that involved someone asking me how I successfully "broke" into the information security field. Although this topic has been covered quite a bit, I felt it would be beneficial to offer my two cents to others looking to follow a similar path.

Foundation, Foundation, Foundation 
------

From a very high level, implementing or breaking security is dependent on the individual's ability to execute the following:

1. Understand the system or technology and how it operates normally (according to its design)
2. <span style="color:red">Red</span> - Abuse or otherwise divert the target from its normal behavior to achieve a malicious goal  
<span style="color:blue">Blue</span> - Triage with red team knowledge to further secure the target 

Although this appears to be generic advice out-of-the-box, this resonates with me more and more each day. Without comprehensive and intimate knowledge of your target, it becomes exponentially more difficult to secure or compromise said target. Depending on your particular area of interest (perhaps it's all of them), I've provided several topics that I believe are crucial to allow someone entering the field to hit the ground running.

| Network Security	| Application Security 							| RE / ExploitDev 		|
|:------------------|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------|
| TCP/IP  			| HTTP/HTTPS		 							| Computer Architecture |
| Active Directory 	| Authentication/Authorization 					| Assembly Language		|
| Wireless     		| Website Development (e.g., HTML,JavaScript) 	| Debugging   		  	|	
| Windows Admin		| Databases/Data Stores						  	| Disassemblers  		|	
| Linux Admin		| Cryptography		 						  	| Virtualization		|

Education 
------

There has been (and still is) quite a bit of debate circling this particular topic. For the most part, some claim that an official education, either by way of university, trade school, or something similar, is vital for an aspiring information security professional. Others firmly believe that self-study and personal projects lead to the valued experience necessary to succeed.

Let me be clear, although the route to my professional career took me through academic schooling, this is certainly **not** the only route. I know a slew of security professionals from varying walks of life - philosophers, physics majors, former art and theater students. Some of these bright minds decided not to pursue an official education beyond high school, and they're phenomenal at what they do. In my eyes, that's one (of many) particular aspect of this industry that makes it unique.
